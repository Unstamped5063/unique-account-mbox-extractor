    - The script will check for `.mbox` files in the current directory and prompt you to confirm if you want to use the found file.
    - If no `.mbox` file is found, you will be prompted to enter the path to your `.mbox` file.

4. **Output:**
    - The script will process the emails and extract unique primary domains.
    - The unique primary domains will be saved to a file named `unique_primary_domains.txt` in the project directory.
